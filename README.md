# 🎓 Sage University App Clone

A professional Flutter application developed as a clone of the **Sage University Student Portal**. This project marks my journey from learning Flutter basics to building a complex, multi-screen functional application.

## 🚀 About the Project
This app replicates the student dashboard experience, allowing users to manage their academic life. It demonstrates my ability to build clean UIs, handle navigation between many screens, and organize code effectively.

## ✨ Key Features
I have implemented the following core modules:
* **Authentication:** Custom Login and Registration system (`LoginPage.dart`, `RagistrationPage.dart`).
* **Academic Tools:** Integrated Time Table, Exam schedules, and Curriculum views.
* **Student Services:** Modules for Hostel, Library, and Transportation management.
* **Communication:** Grievance portal, "Sage Buzz" for news, and Social Media connectivity.
* **Daily Tracking:** Attendance management and Assignment tracking.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Shown
* **UI/UX:** Created custom Splash screens, TabBars, and Drawer navigation.
* **Navigation:** Managed routing for over 25+ unique Dart files.
* **Assets:** Proper implementation of custom branding and university-specific assets.
* **Clean Code:** Organized the project structure into a dedicated `Sage_clone_app` directory.

## 📱 Project Structure
Inside the `lib/Sage_clone_app/` folder, you will find:
* `SageSplach.dart` - Professional entry splash screen.
* `SageApp.dart` - Main application logic.
* `Attendance.dart` / `Saveattendance.dart` - Attendance tracking system.
* `Studentinfo.dart` - Personal profile management.
